# OnlineCinema
Course work "Online Cinema" - Node.JS, Express, MongoDB

Hello! This is something like an online cinema (I hope). In developing used Node.JS, Express and MongoDB.

The administrator can add movies and series to the site, edit or delete them. Users can sort movies by genres, by release date, by date of addition to the site or in alphabetical order. User can find favorite movie and watch it. User has access to detailed information about the film: director, ratings, country, actors, awards, etc. Registered users can add movies to their favorite list, write reviews to movies. This and other information is displayed in their profiles.

All settings are stored in the config.json file. They must be changed! Dependencies can be viewed in the package.json file. File createDB.js is useful for initializing the database.

Well, something like this. GL & HF :)
